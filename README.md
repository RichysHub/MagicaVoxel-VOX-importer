This is a fork of [RichysHub / MagicaVoxel-VOX-importer](https://github.com/RichysHub/MagicaVoxel-VOX-importer)

## Getting Started

### Installation

This add-on needs to be installed into Blender in order to be used.
Directions for this process can be found [here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html#rd-party-add-ons) directly from the Blender Documentation.

Only [`io_scene_meebits_vox.py`](io_scene_meebits_vox.py) need be installed, other files in this repository are not functionally required.

**Note:** in order to enable the add-on, you will need to have `Testing` add-ons visible within the Blender Preferences menu.

### Usage

With the add-on installed and enabled, the importer can be accessed from `File > Import > Meebit (.vox)`

### Import options

This add-on offers several import options, seen on the file select menu of the import.

![Import Options](https://i.imgur.com/Syyxs8E.png)

- *Voxel Spacing*: controls distance center to center of neighbouring voxels.
- *Voxel Size*: how large each voxel should be, in Blender Units.
- *Animation frame to load*: for `.vox` files that contain animation frames, only 1 frame may be imported at a time, this option selects that value. If a value is given that exceeds the final frame, the final frame is used instead.
- *Use Voxel Bounds*: import only a sub-set of the model, potentially useful for loading larger models.
  - *Start Voxel* / *End Voxel*: define which voxels to import.
- *Use Palette Colors*: should the colors present in the `.vox` file be imported as materials?
- *Gamma Correct Colors*: in order to reproduce colors in the render, colors in the palette are gamma corrected. Disabling this will likely cause discoloration compared to the model when viewed in MagicaVoxel.
  - *Gamma Correction Value*: value of color correction, default of 2.2, see [here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/color_management.html) for more information.
- *Use Shadeless Materials*: makes materials 'shadeless' by changing the material type to emissive.
- *Join Voxels*: currently na√Øve option to perform a join operation on the voxels after import. This will make manipulating the model much more performant, though is not suitable in all cases, i.e. physics simulations.
